# Multi-reference factor analysis: low-rank covariance estimation under unknown translations

As part of my homework, I needed to implement  the paper: "Multi-reference factor analysis: low-rank covariance estimation under unknown translations"(https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00211) by Boris Landa and Yoel Shkolnisky.

Optimization problems were solved using `cvxpy` and `scipy` libraries.
